Result log for shopping list
NOTE: Rev 1.1 of this log contains results before the following changes:
   1) removeSmallCOpies tries to identify original
   2) COPY_THRESHOLD => 128
   3) remSmCp and matchSimUnm. changed order (yields correct update in run 3)

=1= 
Result: OK 

Breaks with too low copy threshold. (inserted nodes treated as copies) 
Yields one confl. warning due to sequencing inserts, OK.

Insertions/copies in both branches after the context nodes. Sequencing the insertions.

=2=
Result: OK 

Warnings about sequencing insertions are OK: After salmon L4 adds apples &
comic, L1 adds oriange juice & toilet paper. 
Breaks with too low copy threshold. (inserted nodes treated as copies) 

Bug in the original case: merge & computer updates were both in L5. Now split
so L5 = after merge, L6 = after computer has re-evaluated some fields

=3=

Result: OK

The correct updating of Toast qty (packets) depends on order of matchSimUnm
and removeSmaCop that identifies "original" instance. (Req Matching 1.15)
Edit script was checked by running the markup rutine in class TreeDM and
reading marked.xml.

=4=

Result: OK

Diff + patch works. In this case, however, patch.xml is larger than the output
L7.xml, so sending a patch is useless in terms of saving bandwidth!

A text patch produced by diff is also > L7, and slightly smaller than the XML
variant. See this:
 
tko-dhcp-42:~/ubidoc/usecases/shopping> ls -l pa* g7.xml L7.xml
-rw-r--r--    1 ctl      ctl          1301 Jun 15 15:58 L7.xml
-rw-r--r--    1 ctl      ctl          1135 Jun 18 11:09 g7.xml
-rw-r--r--    1 ctl      ctl          1570 Jun 18 11:12 patch.txt

Conclusion:

What didn't work: - patch space saving
                  - Case induced changes to Matching.java (old vers < 1.14)
                    had problems with tuining copythreshold
		  - Bugs in the case (invalid XML, one step forgotten)
	
What worked:	  - Everything!
                    = merging, generating edit script (even updates correct!),
                      diffing & patching
