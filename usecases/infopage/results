Result: PROBLEMS (As expected) + GLITCH

As expected, the sloppy structure causes some changes not to be propagated
to the homepage. Luckily, these unpropagated changes are visible in the
conflict log:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<conflictlist>
 <warnings>
  <delete>
Modifications in deleted subtree.
   <node tree="merged" path="/0" />
   <node tree="base" path="/0/1" />
   <node tree="branch1" path="/0/1" />
  </delete>
  <delete>
Modifications in deleted subtree.
   <node tree="merged" path="/0" />
   <node tree="base" path="/0/4" />
   <node tree="branch1" path="/0/4" />
  </delete>
 </warnings>
</conflictlist>

The non-propagating fields was telephone number (as there is no exact text like
this in homepage.html, the number is mentioned in a sententnce), and the zip
(As it was combined with the city in the address field on the page).

An unexpected glitch was that the update "Peräseinäjoki" -> "Takaseinäjoki"
was reflected to the wrong location ("I work as a techer at the elmentary 
school in Takaseinjoki").

This glitch could have been avoided if matching nodes a required to be
"clustered" in some sense, i.e. if a node is moved a long distance, it's
neighbours should be moved to approx the same location.

The changes can be checked with
3dm -e --merge homepage.html ghomepage2.html homepage.html > /dev/null

yielding
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<edits>
 <update path="/0/1/7/0/3/0" src="/0/1/7/0/3/0" originTree="branch1" originNode="/0/1/7/0/3/0" />
 <update path="/0/1/9/0/2" src="/0/1/9/0/2" originTree="branch1" originNode="/0/1/9/0/2" />
</edits>

Which is correct!

Results: AS EXPECTED (Phoneno update missing)

The phoneno update is missed, ast a corresponding node does not exist in the
dst page (the no is mentioned in a sentence). Conflict warnings to the rescue,
they warn about an update being lost:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<conflictlist>
 <warnings>
  <delete>
Modifications in deleted subtree.
   <node tree="merged" path="/0/1" />
   <node tree="base" path="/0/1/8" />
   <node tree="branch1" path="/0/1/8" />
  </delete>
 </warnings>
</conflictlist>
