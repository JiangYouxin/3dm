Result: OK, but not exactly as facit

The changes made are:
1 inserted <em>chairman</em>
2 inserted <em>secretary</em>
3 added hyperlink to pritbut Chess FAQ (para text changed as well)
4 <li> "Use a chess-specific w..." removed
5 updated "- Chess.Net..." to "Chess.Net"
(+ CVS $Id\$ changed)

3,4,5 behaved as expected, OK
1,2 were not inserted inside the font tag. This is quite natural, since the
matching looked like this
                           
       1 li                   1  li              1 li
        / \                      |                  |
2 Jussi V   em *              2 Jussi V            font *
             |                                      |
            chairman *                          2 Jussi V

Thus, we have two inserts: em and font + Jussi V is moved away => sequencing 
warning. By luck, they were sequenced in the correct order, not <em>,<font>

What's the problem? Formatting command + edit (ins em) "too close" to another.
If the font command had been outside the <ul> thing could have worked, also
if we'd just updated the text nodes. Lessons:

1) Edits that are too close may cause trouble
2) 3dm warned about this (Seq. warnings in conflict.log), helps human 
   reviewers! 
3) In html formatting may interfere with merge

=> When syncing, the common data between the files should not be "chopped"
up to much (try including unedited subtrees)

The edit script (for ID'ng changes) looks PERFECT!

The conflict log has 1 conflict + 3 warnings. 2 are sequ warnings from the 
above. The conflict is due to the $ Id $ text changing in both => OK. There
is a varning about edits being lost for the deletion (4), due to the insertion
of a formatting command ("<small>" in ccs-complex) in the deleted node.
