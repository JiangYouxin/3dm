Merge cases: Purpose?

- to demonstrate desired merging behaviour in various cases
  (=> exact definition of reasonable merging behaviour??)
- to test the merge tool against

These are the merge cases
(Mxx) is the case depicted
[Mxx] is a similar case

Insertion
=========

i1 Simple insertion i different subtrees (M18) [M14] 
i2 Same subtree, end of list / same pos; can be seen as conflict (M19)
i3 Several inserts in same subtree; can be seen as conflict (M16)

Deletion
========

d1 Simple deletion in different subtrees (M13)
d2 Deletion of same node (M21)
d3 Several deletions in same subtree (M20)

Conflicts cannot occur with deletions only.

Updates
=======


u1 Update of differnt nodes (M12)
u2 Update of same node, updates identical (possibly conflict all the same?)
u3 CONFLICT: Same node, different updates  

Moves
=====

m1 Moves in different childlist (renders uglily) (M24)
m2 Moves in same childlist (M4)
m3 Moves at different levels of same subtree (M5)
m4 Move conflict RENDERING BUGS! (M22)
m5 Move with shifting (M25)

Copies
======

c1 Copies into different childlists RENDER PROBS
c2 Copies to same childlist (M28)
c3 Copy with shifting (M26)
c4 CONFLICT: Differnt node to same dest (M27)
c5 Copy with shift (M23)

Combinations
============

	INS DEL UPD MOV CPY 
a1	2       1            Simple combination of insert and update (M10)
a2	    1   2	     Simple combination of del and update (M9)
a3                  2   1    Moving the src-of-copy node, possibly a conflict? (M15)
a4		    1   2    Case where a node does NOT reprsenet it's subtree (M8)
a5		1       2    Regular case (M7)			
a6	            1   2    Node rep. subtree, changes in subtree reflected (M2)
a7		    2   1    Moving away an overcopied node (M29)
a8          1           2    Copying a subtree, and deleting a node from it (M1)
a9	            2   1    Copies generate different "models": possibly conflict (M11)
a10		2   1        Update + swap (Jyrki's case) (M10B)
a11	2           1        Does inserted move with previous? (M17)
a12	2           1   1    Possible mov+ins conflict (same pos) (M32)
a13	        1   2        Basic annotation (M3)
a14	        1       2    Updates reflect to all copies (M6)
